#Secret Sauce with Jasmine

Simple encryption app written in Javascript with an integration of Jasmine and Javascript testing
by James Chuang

## Description
Secret Sauce is a simple encryption app that encrypts a simple message with a password using the AES.js script. It then outputs the link for decryptions along with the encrypted message. The user can then navigate to the decrypt page with that url and the program will parse the url and get the encrypted messaged, ask the user for a password, and display the original message.

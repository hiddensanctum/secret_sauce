# Secret Sauce

This is a basic javascript encrypt and decrypt program that allows a user to enter a message and encrypt it with a password using the AES encryption method. The program returns a URL to the decrption page with the encrypted message in the URL. If the user goes to that specific url and clicks on decrypt, the script get the encrpyted message from the url and prompts the user for a password. If the password matches, it will display the correct message to the user.
